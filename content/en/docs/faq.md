  CreditCapital: Frequently Asked Questions
---
### Was there a presale for CAPL?
No, there is not a “Presale” like a NFT, ICO, or STO of the past. By buying and using CAPL you are integrating into the live system. So there is no need for a presale drop or launch of CAPL tokens. The good news is that you can get your CAPL now and become an early adopter at a point where the platform has real utility. 

### How does CreditCapital improve mutual investing?
CreditCapital improves mutual investing through seamless smart-contract integration and DAO oversight. The ability to quickly join and invest without the legal red-tape and difficult share agreement models allow revenue sharing in the Capital Pool’s low-risk investments. 

### What is the advantage of borrowing against my own crypto? 
Normally, holding crypto assets means that your assets are illiquid until you sell them, or trade them into other assets. Holding BTC for instance has great long term potential, however doing so means you lose out on the bulk of your liquidity in the present. 

By borrowing against your crypto portfolio and minting CCUSD, you are leveraging your assets to access additional liquidity while maintaining ownership of your original asset. With a stable token loan in CCUSD you can continue trading for revenue with your original assets temporarily locked in a smart contract.

### Where do I earn CAPL?
CAPL is earned by staking Liquidity Pool (LP) tokens, which are gained from Liquidity Pools, into a Vault. When an LP token is staked into a Vault it begins generating per-block CAPL in the rewards pool. These rewards may be withdrawn at any time, or compounded back into the system for additional earnings.

### How do I mint LP Tokens?
After depositing capital as liquidity into a liquidity pool, LP tokens are issued automatically to your account. LP tokens will be exclusive to the pool they come from.

In the future, CreditCapital may integrate a Dynamic Reallocation feature to the LP Staking mechanism. This may allow the ability for Users to move a percentage of LP tokens to and from different pools while retaining the same staking terms. 

### How is CCUSD Stabilized?
(maintaining multiple liquidity pools to other stable tokens, other ideas? A protocol based guarantee?)

Through customized liquidity pools for outside stable tokens, the fluctuations in price incentivize new users and holders of outside stable tokens to bring new funds to the platform and CCUSD. This balances the CCUSD price by creating arbitrage or trading opportunities for stable token traders and enables staking into the platform for revenue share and CAPL rewards.
